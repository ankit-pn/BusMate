\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed software requirements 
specification for the {\projectName} Web Application. 
It outlines the functionalities, constraints, and performance requirements 
of the application.

\section{Scope}
The Microbus Transportation Web Application aims to connect microbus drivers 
and passengers in real-time. 
It addresses the challenge of passengers waiting for microbuses that 
do not align with their needs, while drivers are unaware of potential 
passengers along their routes. 
The application seeks to improve the transportation experience by providing 
a platform for efficient communication and coordination between 
drivers and passengers.

\chapter{Overall Description}
\section{Product Perspective}
The Microbus Transportation Web Application will be a standalone system, 
interacting with microbus drivers and passengers through a user-friendly 
web interface. It will not rely on any external systems for its core 
functionality, but may utilize geolocation services and payment gateways for 
additional features.

\section{Product Features}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Real-time microbus tracking and availability display
  \item Passenger registration and profile management
  \item Driver registration and profile management
  \item Route selection and scheduling for drivers
  \item Passenger search and booking for available microbuses
  \item Notifications for drivers and passengers regarding trip updates
\end{itemize}

\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
The Microbus Transportation Web Application will have two primary user classes: 
passengers and drivers. Passengers will include individuals who rely on 
microbuses for transportation, while drivers will be microbus owners or 
operators. 
Both user classes are expected to have basic computer literacy and 
access to the internet.
